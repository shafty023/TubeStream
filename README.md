TubeStream
==========

TubeStream is a simple application that will play any YouTube video in the background.
The difference from other applications is TubeStream contains no UI and will post an interactive notification
with play controls to manage the video that is playing. You interact directly with your stock YouTube application
and play the video in TubeStream by "sharing" the video to TubeStream. It's as simple as that.

There's no application icon and TubeStream is there only when you need it. Think of it as a plugin for YouTube giving
you something YouTube is unable to do.
